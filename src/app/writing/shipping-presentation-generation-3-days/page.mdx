# Building My First Next.js Application

## Introduction

This is my first technical blog post where I'll share my experience building this personal website using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Why Next.js?

I chose Next.js for this project because:
- **Server-side rendering** for better SEO
- **File-based routing** for simple navigation
- **Built-in optimizations** for performance
- **Great developer experience** with hot reloading
- **TypeScript support** out of the box

## Key Features I Implemented

### Dark Mode Toggle
One of the first features I wanted was a dark/light mode toggle. This was surprisingly straightforward with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

### Responsive Design
Making sure the site looks great on all devices was a priority. Tailwind CSS made this much easier than expected.

### Project Showcase
I created a projects page to showcase my work. Each project has:
- A description
- Technologies used
- Links to GitHub and live demo
- Search functionality

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start simple**: Don't overcomplicate things at the beginning
2. **Use Tailwind CSS**: It speeds up development significantly
3. **Plan your content**: Know what you want to showcase before building
4. **Test on mobile**: Always check how it looks on different screen sizes

## Next Steps

I plan to add:
- More blog posts about my learning journey
- A contact form
- Integration with a CMS for easier content updates
- Analytics to track visitor engagement

## Conclusion

Building this website has been a great learning experience. Next.js and Tailwind CSS make it easy to create professional-looking applications quickly.

I'm excited to continue adding features and sharing my journey as I learn more about web development.
